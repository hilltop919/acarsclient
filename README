acarsclient is a client for acarsd.org servers.

Initially started as a project to read ACARS data from an Android app, I stopped my
work on this client because the acarsd.org project is in a sad state and it seems that
work on it has been discontinued.

The project's home page is here: http://www.shredzone.org/projects/szo/wiki/Acarsclient
